## 笔记

- **[2005] Estimating 3D Shape and Texture Using Pixel Intensity, Edges, Specular Highlights, Texture Constraints and a Prior**[^4]
  
  [**StackOverflow**: 3D morphable model fitting to an image ( face reconstruction)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24512728/3d-morphable-model-fitting-to-an-image-face-reconstruction)

- **[2015] Face Alignment Across Large Poses: A 3D Solution [^1]**
  
  Code: [http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/)
  Project: [http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/main.htm](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/xiangyuzhu/projects/3DDFA/main.htm)

- **[2015] High-Fidelity Pose and Expression Normalization for Face Recognition in the Wild**[^2]
  
  利用 Non-Rigid ICP[^5] 算法融合 Basel Face Model ID 基和 Face Warehouse 的表情基.

  **疑点**:
  1. 锚点调整时, contour点事直接确定的还是参与最小二乘?

- **[2017] CNN-based Real-time Dense Face Reconstruction with Inverse-rendered Photo-realistic Face Images**[^3]

  > - the optimization-based face inverse rendering that recovers accurate `geometry`, `albedo`, `lighting` from a single image, with which we can generate a large number of photo-realistic face images with different attributes to train our networks.
  > - a large photo-realistic face image dataset with the labels of the parametric face model parameters and the pose parameters, which are generated based on our proposed inverse rendering. This dataset facilitates the training of our Single-image CoarseNet and makes our method robust to expressions and poses.
  > - a large photo-realistic fine-scale face image dataset with detailed geometry labels, which are generated by our proposed face detail transfer approach. This fine-scale dataset facilitates the training of our FineNet.
  > - a large dataset for training Tracking CoarseNet, where we extend the Single-image CoarseNet training data by simulating their previous frames according to the statistics learned from real facial videos.
  > the proposed 3DFaceNet that is trained with our built large- scale diverse synthetic data and is thus able to reconstruct the fine-scale geometry, albedo and lighting well in real time from monocular RGB video as well a single image. Our system is robust to large poses, extreme expressions and fast moving faces.

  一些疑点:
  1. 如何将 FaceWareHouse 的blend shape 迁移到 BFM 模型上
  2. 在渲染增益样本中, 是如何处理背景的变形的, 这部分操作与 3DDFA 有何异同?

### Blendshape 的提出

- **[2017] Morphable Face Models - An Open Framework**[^8]


### 3DMM Construction Pipeline


### 关于轮廓点对应的处理

1. 直接舍弃
2. 基于姿态建立映射表[^6]
3. 平行线[^2]

### 深度方法
